## Overview of Analysis
For this challenege I have been tasked with using citi bike data from New York to create vizualizations on Tableau to help convince investors to create a ride sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. I were tasked with first transforming the trip duration to datetime on jupyter notebook. Then I had to create visualizations using this citi data to portray a story to the investors.

## Summary
Looking at the results we can see a few things. First, for the bike repair, we can see that the best time to repair overused bikes would be between 1-5 am as that is the lowest point of bike usage. We can then see that the peak trip duration is around 5 minutes. We can also see that males and females use the bikes for different durations but not by much. Also, we can see that the average time that bikes are used by users is early in the morning, 8 am, and afternoon, 5 pm ( around the time work gets off). The same can be said when we look at it by gender as they are similar but Males still use the service more than females. We can also see that there are more subscribers than customers and that Males are more dominant as the users. Looking at the data two more visualizations I would make are looking at the average age of users and the average tripduration based on user age.
